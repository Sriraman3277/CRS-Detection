Early detection of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) after CART-therapy through machine learning (ML) models using cytokine and wearable data.
==============================

## Abstract

This project investigates the potential of using machine learning to predict Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) onset in patients undergoing CAR-T cell therapy. CRS is a life-threatening side effect in cancer treatment, and its early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Current methods for monitoring CRS in CAR-T therapy limit the feasibility of outpatient care. This study explores the use of machine learning to analyze data from wearable devices and blood tests (cytokine levels) to predict CRS onset earlier, potentially enabling safer outpatient CAR-T therapy.
Data was collected from two sources: cytokine levels measured in blood samples from infusion day to discharge, and continuous vital signs monitored by wearable devices over a year. Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) revealed the significance of cytokine levels in CRS prediction and highlighted trends in cytokine and temperature values over time. The methodology involved training Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to analyze sequential patterns of data for early CRS prediction. Models were trained and evaluated using three distinct datasets: cytokine data, wearable data, and merged data. The evaluation included calculating the early detection time, defined as the time difference between predicted CRS onset and actual CRS onset. The models demonstrated good accuracy, with early detection times ranging from 5 to 14 hours.
By providing a robust framework for early CRS detection, the predictive model has the potential to significantly reduce hospital stays and healthcare costs while improving the quality of life for patients. This marks a notable advancement in personalized care for Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients undergoing CAR-T therapy.


## Introduction :

CRS stands for Cytokine Release Syndrome, which is a potentially serious side effect associated with certain immunotherapy treatments, particularly CAR T-cell therapy. CAR T-cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy where a patient's T cells (a type of immune cell) are genetically modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). These receptors allow the T cells to recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively. In multiple myeloma, CAR T-cell therapy holds promise as a potential treatment option, particularly for patients who have relapsed or become refractory to standard treatments. However, like in other cancers, the development of CRS is a significant concern in the context of CAR T-cell therapy for multiple myeloma.

Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells, which are a type of white blood cell responsible for producing antibodies. CAR T-cell therapy for multiple myeloma involves genetically modifying a patient's T cells to target a specific protein, such as BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen), which is highly expressed on the surface of myeloma cells.

When infused into the patient, these engineered CAR T cells recognize and bind to myeloma cells, leading to their destruction. However, this process can trigger an immune response and the release of cytokines, resulting in CRS. CRS is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome characterized by the excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines into the bloodstream. It can manifest as fever, hypotension, capillary leak syndrome, and multi-organ dysfunction, ranging from mild to life-threatening severity. CRS is particularly prevalent in patients undergoing CAR T-cell therapy, where the activation and expansion of genetically engineered T cells lead to an immune cascade and cytokine storm.

Overview :
The objective of this capstone project is to develop machine learning models to enable the early detection of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) in patients undergoing Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR T-cell) therapy. CRS is a potentially severe complication associated with CAR T-cell therapy, particularly in the treatment of multiple myeloma. Early detection of CRS is crucial for timely intervention and management, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze cytokine levels and wearable device data for the early detection of CRS.

# Project Title  
  
Pre-symptomatic detection of CRS using wearable data 
  
## Project Description 

Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) is a significant and potentially life-threatening condition associated with immune-based therapies, especially in cancer treatment. CRS occurs due to elevated levels of circulating cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon Î³, which can result from the administration of therapies like bispecific antibodies and adoptive T-cell therapies. Symptoms of CRS can range from mild to severe, including fever, nausea, hypotension, and life-threatening organ dysfunction 

The rapid identification and treatment of CRS are critical for patient outcomes. This capstone project proposes the development of a predictive model leveraging machine learning algorithms to anticipate the onset of CRS in patient's multiple myeloma (MM). Utilizing continuous, real-time physiological data collected from wearable monitoring devices alongside discrete biomarker data from bloodwork, we aim to predict the likelihood of CRS before clinical symptoms manifest. 

The project will involve working with timeseries data, including temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, and biomarker levels indicative of inflammatory responses. Preprocessing techniques will standardize and clean the dataset, preparing it for exploratory data analysis to identify patterns correlated with CRS events. Subsequent feature engineering will aim to improve the predictive power of the machine learning models by synthesizing the raw data into informative metrics. 

We plan to evaluate several algorithms, ranging from traditional machine learning approaches, like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machines, to advanced deep learning models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, for their ability to predict CRS. The performance of these models will be rigorously tested through validation techniques, and their predictions will be compared against standard clinical observations to determine the earliest and most reliable indicators of CRS. 

This research aspires to facilitate the transition from inpatient to outpatient CAR-T therapy administration by providing a robust framework for early CRS detection. If successful, this predictive model could significantly reduce hospital stays, healthcare costs, and improve patient quality of life, marking a notable advancement in the personalized care of MM patients.
